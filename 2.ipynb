    "Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical technique used to compare the means of three or more groups to find out if at least one group mean is statistically different from the others. There are three primary types of ANOVA, each suited for different situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Way ANOVA (Between-Groups ANOVA):\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: When you want to compare the means of more than two groups based on one independent variable. For example, you might use a one-way ANOVA to compare the effectiveness of different diets (vegan, vegetarian, omnivore) on weight loss. Here, diet type is the only independent variable, and weight loss is the dependent variable.\n",
    "Assumptions: Normal distribution of residuals, homogeneity of variance (equal variances among groups), and independence of observations.\n",
    "Two-Way ANOVA (Factorial ANOVA):\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: When you want to study the effect of two independent variables on a dependent variable, as well as any interaction effect between the independent variables. For instance, a two-way ANOVA could be used to analyze how gender (male, female) and diet type (vegan, vegetarian, omnivore) together affect weight loss. This not only looks at each factor independently but also whether there's an interaction effect (e.g., does diet impact weight loss differently based on gender?).\n",
    "Assumptions: Similar to one-way ANOVA, including the normal distribution of residuals, homogeneity of variances, and independence of observations. Additionally, it assumes no significant interaction effects unless that is specifically what's being tested.\n",
    "Repeated Measures ANOVA:\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: When the same subjects are used in all treatment groups, and you want to compare the means across these groups. This is particularly common in longitudinal studies where measurements are taken from the same subjects over time. For example, you might use a repeated measures ANOVA to assess the cognitive skills of a group of subjects before, during, and after completing a training program.\n",
    "Assumptions: Besides the assumptions of normality and sphericity (a condition about the variances of the differences between levels), repeated measures ANOVA also requires the assumption of independence of observations. However, because the same subjects are used in each group, this assumption refers to the independence of the treatment groups rather than the individual subjects.\n",
    "Each type of ANOVA is best suited for different experimental designs and research questions. The choice of ANOVA depends on the number of independent variables and whether the same or different subjects are in the groups being compared.\n",
