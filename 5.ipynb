    "In a two-way ANOVA, the main effects and interaction effects can be calculated using Python with libraries such as statsmodels. The two-way ANOVA is used to understand if there is an interaction between the two independent variables on a dependent variable. It considers two factors (independent variables) and their interaction.\n",
