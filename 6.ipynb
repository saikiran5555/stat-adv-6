    "When you conduct a one-way ANOVA and obtain specific results for the F-statistic and the p-value, you interpret these results to understand whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the groups being compared. In your case, you have an F-statistic of 5.23 and a p-value of 0.02. Here's how to interpret these results:\n",
    "\n",
    "F-statistic (5.23): The F-statistic is a ratio of the variance between the group means to the variance within the groups. An F-statistic value greater than 1 suggests that there is more variability between the groups than within them. In your case, an F-statistic of 5.23 indicates that there is a notable difference in variability between groups compared to within groups. This suggests that the group means are not all the same, but it doesn't tell you which groups are different from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "P-value (0.02): The p-value indicates the probability of observing a result as extreme as, or more extreme than, what was actually observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. The null hypothesis in ANOVA is typically that all group means are equal (no difference between groups). A p-value of 0.02 means there's a 2% probability that the observed differences (or more extreme differences) in group means could occur due to random chance alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the p-value (0.02) is less than the common alpha level of 0.05, you would reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is statistically significant evidence to conclude that not all group means are equal. In other words, the differences between at least some of the groups are significant and not just due to random variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the ANOVA test doesn't tell you which specific groups are different from each other. To determine this, you would need to conduct a post-hoc test (like Tukey's HSD, Bonferroni, etc.)."
