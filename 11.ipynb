    "To conduct a two-sample t-test using Python, we'll first need the test scores for the 100 students. In the absence of actual data, I'll create hypothetical data for demonstration purposes. If you have specific data, you can replace the hypothetical data with your actual data.\n",

    "However, for a two-sample t-test, a post-hoc test isn't typically conducted because the test itself directly compares the two groups. Post-hoc tests are more commonly used in scenarios where multiple comparisons are made (like in ANOVA). In this case, if the t-test is significant, it already indicates which group (experimental) differs from the control group.\n",
